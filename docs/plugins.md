# Plugins and Knowledge Formats

OpenLore plugins extend policy, validation, metadata, and processing while core
commands continue to own the user-facing shell surface.

## Provider interfaces

| Interface | Contribution |
|---|---|
| `WriteMiddlewareProvider` | Admission middleware before commit |
| `ReadMiddlewareProvider` | Middleware before reads |
| `PostCommitProvider` | Middleware after successful commits |
| `GrantTypeProvider` | Named grant types such as `publish` |
| `ValidatorProvider` | Checks run by `lore validate` |
| `MetaExtenderProvider` | Fields added to `lore meta` records |
| `PluginInfoProvider` | Plugin name and semantic version logged at boot |
| `MetricsEmitterProvider` | Namespaced `plugin.<name>.*` analytics events |
| `MetricsSubscriberProvider` | Persisted analytics event consumers |
| `MetricsProcessorProvider` | Post-persistence derived-event processors |
| `ContentScalarProviderProvider` | Content-derived scalar values |
| `TokenizerProvider` | Exact tokenizer replacing the built-in approximation |
| `AggregationProvider` | Analytics aggregations shown in the CLI, API, and dashboard |

Built-in plugins include `shellexec`, `inbox`, and `okf`. Go consumers register
additional plugins through `Server.RegisterPlugin`.

Admission middleware receives an immutable `WriteOp`. It **must** use
`WriteOp.Leaves()` and inspect every leaf; batches are one policy decision and
the first leaf is not representative. Construct operations with `NewWriteOp`.
Middleware that defers an operation uses `op.Pending(ref)`, which captures the
complete immutable batch for persistence and later replay.

Analytics-capable plugins must also implement `PluginInfoProvider`; its stable
lowercase name defines their event and aggregation namespace. Emitters receive
an `AnalyticsSink` during registration. Subscribers and processors run in the
post-persistence pipeline, not on the command path. Scalar providers are used
for both live content facts and history-derived `doc.scalars`; changing a
tokenizer takes effect when `analytics replay` recomputes history.

Plugin analytics events must be emitted through the sink supplied to
`SetAnalyticsSink`, including events produced by plugin commands. Calling the
shell's built-in `EmitMetric` seam directly is reserved for core commands and
does not apply the plugin namespace. Derived processor events are forced into
the same namespace. Scalar providers may add new flat keys,
but the built-in `bytes`, `lines`, `words`, and `tokens` keys are reserved;
plugins replace token counting through `TokenizerProvider` instead.

## Open Knowledge Format validation

The built-in OKF plugin validates knowledge against the
[Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md).
It targets spec v0.2 and also accepts v0.1 bundles: a bundle declaring
`okf_version: "0.1"` in its root `index.md` is linted against v0.1 rules,
anything else against v0.2. Hard conformance violations are errors; shape
problems in a version's optional field families (e.g. v0.2 `sources`,
`generated`, `verified`, `status`, Attested Computation contracts) are
warnings from `lore validate`. Enable it per docset:

```json
{
  "docsets": {
    "wiki": {
      "paths": ["/wiki"],
      "okf": {
        "patterns": ["*.md"],
        "enforce": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Validation runs before content reaches disk for every write verb. `patterns`
defaults to `["*.md"]`; `enforce` defaults to `true`, while `false` logs and
allows findings.

The owning docset's configuration governs each target. Use nested docsets to
scope validation more narrowly or to exempt a subtree from its parent's policy.

The `okf` block is shorthand for four [folder rules](folder-rules.md): `okf`
(checked on write), plus `okf/bundle`, `link/resolves` and `link/alias`
(checked by `lore validate` only). Declare them under `docsets.<name>.rules`
instead when you want to combine them with other members such as `size/lines`,
or scope them with `match`/`exclude` globs.

Downstream Go code can apply the same rules directly:

```go
import "github.com/aakarim/go-openlore/pkg/okf"

if err := okf.Validate(path, content); err != nil {
	// Content is not OKF-conformant.
}
```

## Bundle linting with `lore validate`

`lore validate [bundle]` scans the current or selected bundle, invokes enabled
plugin validators, and adds OpenLore's local-link and alias-portability checks:

```text
tables/orders.md:1:1: error [okf/concept] frontmatter is missing the required non-empty 'type' field
metrics/revenue.md:12:19: error [openlore/broken-link] local link "../tables/missing.md" does not resolve
metrics/revenue.md:15:8: warning [openlore/alias-target] link targets aliased docset path /wiki; it may resolve differently on another machine
2 errors, 1 warning
```

- `okf/*` findings come from OKF conformance rules.
- `openlore/broken-link` and `openlore/link-outside-bundle` are operational
  errors; OKF itself permits consumers to tolerate broken links.
- `openlore/alias-referrer` and `openlore/alias-target` warn that links may not
  be portable to a server with different aliases.

The command does not fetch URLs. Errors produce a non-zero exit status; warnings
alone do not. If no validator plugin is enabled, the command emits
`lore validate: warning: no validators enabled` rather than reporting an empty
scan as valid.

## Metadata queries with `lore meta`

`lore meta [path]` walks readable Markdown documents under the current directory
or path and emits parseable YAML frontmatter as one JSON object per line. Bodies
remain out of the response, keeping discovery cheap:

```bash
cd backend
lore meta
lore meta | jq -r .type | sort -u
lore meta | jq -r 'select(.type=="Metric").path' | xargs cat
```

The walk uses the session filesystem, so it cannot reveal documents outside the
identity's read scope.

When OKF applies to a document, the plugin enriches its metadata record:

```json
{"path":"orders.md","type":"Table","okf":{"valid":true}}
{"path":"draft.md","title":"No type","okf":{"valid":false,"error":"frontmatter is missing the required non-empty 'type' field"}}
```

```bash
lore meta | jq -r 'select(.okf.valid == false) | .path'
```

## Install the Agent Skills plugin

Enable Skills management in `openlore.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  skills:
    enabled: true
    remote_check_ttl: 60s
    remote_timeout: 3s
    remote_max_bytes: 10MB
```

The defaults shown above are used when the optional remote settings are
omitted. The server must also have writing enabled, and each identity that
manages skills needs the named `rw` grant on its destination docset. A home
docset is implicitly `rw` for its owner.

Docsets do not need a static `agent_skills` setting. After installation, an
authorized user enables a directory as a collection with `skills enable`; the
marker is portable with the directory and can be changed without restarting the
server.

Each immediate child directory is then a skill and must contain an exactly named
`SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter. Writes are checked at admission and again
before serialized commit. Set `metadata.agent_skill: disable` to treat a
parseable `SKILL.md` as ordinary documentation.

Agents discover skills the same way they query OKF metadata. The `skills`
filter scopes `lore meta` to Agent Skills collections and returns only valid
`SKILL.md` records — frontmatter plus the skill's path:

```bash
lore meta --filter skills
lore meta --filter skills | jq -r 'select((.name + " " + .description) | test("pdf"; "i")) | .path'
```

Run bare `skills` for collection management, importing and tracking remote
skills, status checks, updates, and unlinking.
