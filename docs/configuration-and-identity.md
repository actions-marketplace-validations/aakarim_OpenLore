# Configuration and Identity

OpenLore separates server configuration (`openlore.yml`) from identity, role,
and docset policy (`lore.json`).

## Server configuration

Create `openlore.yml` in the project root or pass `--config`:

An explicitly loaded config file takes precedence over an embedded
`openlore.yml` and replaces it rather than merging with it. If no file is
loaded, OpenLore uses the embedded config when present, then built-in defaults;
command-line flags always win.

```yaml
version: "1"

# Enables verbose logs. Unknown shell commands and parser failures are recorded
# as structured debug events to support command/syntax gap analysis.
debug: false

port: 2222
metrics_port: 3000
http_port: 8080
host_key: .ssh/openlore_ed25519
allow_keyless: true
default_cwd: /docs

mcp:
  enabled: true

# Folder rules (see docs/folder-rules.md). `growth` is the default multiplier
# for `max: initial` size rules and must be at least 1. `rules.tokenizer` is
# reserved and rejected at boot until a real tokenizer ships; size/tokens uses
# the built-in estimator.

  growth: 1.25

# tls_key: ./key.pem
```

Analytics uses SQLite by default for both aggregation materializations and the
per-file current-facts cache:

```yaml
analytics:
  enabled: true
  dir: analytics
  aggregations:
    store: sqlite # use file for the legacy materialization store (no facts cache)
  pipeline:
    enabled: true
```

`analytics.enabled: false` disables the complete analytics application,
including durable event logging. To retain events, metrics, and stored views
while pausing analytics processing, leave analytics enabled and set
`analytics.pipeline.enabled: false`. Re-enabling the pipeline catches the
durable event index up from its checkpoint.

One bounded processor handles both content-fact reconciliation and requested
dashboard views. It executes one expensive unit at a time; dashboard demand is
promoted ahead of routine warming without canceling in-flight work. SQLite
stores file facts, ownership-aware directory totals, durable events, completed
dashboard views, and checkpoints. Rows are considered current when size and
modification time match. External edits that preserve both values remain a
known filesystem-metadata blind spot until a later reconciliation-triggering
change.

Debug logging can also be enabled with `openlore --debug`. Unknown-command
events include only the command name, not its arguments. Parser-failure events
include a syntax sample capped at 512 bytes and the parser error.

## Authentication posture

Keyless SSH is enabled by default. Set `allow_keyless: false` to require a
recognized key or another configured authentication method.

Unknown SSH keys are controlled in `lore.json`:

- `"unknown_identity": "allow"` resolves them to the built-in `guest` role.
- `"unknown_identity": "deny"` rejects them.

Keyless and unknown allowed callers use `guest`, which can receive only
read-only grants.

MCP-over-HTTP and the JSON API can inherit this posture or jointly require
OAuth. The existing `mcp.require_auth` setting governs both HTTP transports:

```yaml
mcp:
  enabled: true
  path: /mcp
  require_auth: true
```

If the resolved posture requires a token (`allow_keyless: false` inherited, or
`require_auth: true`) but no `tokens` block is configured, `/mcp` and `/api`
fail closed with 401 and the server logs a warning at startup. Configure
`tokens`, or set `require_auth: false` to serve anonymous HTTP callers.

## Roles, docsets, and identities

```json
{
  "allow_keyless": true,
  "unknown_identity": "allow",
  "default_cwd": "/docs",
  "roles": {
    "backend": {
      "allow": { "capabilities": ["spawn"] }
    }
  },
  "rules": {
    "doc-size": { "match": ["**/*.md"], "use": "size/kilobytes", "with": { "max": 60 }, "default": true }
  },
  "docsets": {
    "public": {
      "paths": ["/docs/public"],
      "access": { "allow": { "guest": "ro", "backend": "ro" } }
    },
    "backend": {
      "paths": ["/docs/api", { "internal/specs": "/docs/specs" }],
      "aliases": ["/api"],
      "access": { "allow": { "backend": "rw" } },
      "rules": {
        "format": { "match": ["**/*.md"], "use": "okf" }
      },
      "config": { "edit": ["backend"] }
    },
    "backend-home": {
      "paths": ["/home/backend"]
    }
  },
  "identities": [
    {
      "name": "backend-agent",
      "public_key": "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...",
      "roles": ["backend"],
      "home": "backend-home"
    }
  ]
}
```

Docsets grant exact role names:

- `ro` reads the docset.
- `publish` reads the docset and writes only inside its configured inbox.
- `rw` reads and writes throughout the docset.
- Plugins may contribute additional grant types.

Multiple roles contribute grants independently. Any matching docset deny wins.
Capability allows form a union across roles, while any capability deny wins.

Folder rules use three keys, all documented in [Folder rules](folder-rules.md):

- Top-level `rules` declares rules that apply to every docset. Each rule has
  `match`, optional `exclude`, `use` (a member such as `size/kilobytes` or
  `okf`), `with` (the member's parameters), `enforce` (default `true`) and
  `default` (`true` lets a folder's `.lore/config.yaml` replace the rule under
  the same name).
- `docsets.<name>.rules` declares rules for that docset's paths, with the same
  shape. The older `docsets.<name>.okf` block is still accepted and is
  equivalent to declaring the `okf`, `okf/bundle`, `link/resolves` and
  `link/alias` rules.
- `docsets.<name>.config.edit` lists the roles allowed to create, edit or
  delete `.lore/config.yaml` files under the docset and to run
  `lore size baseline reset`. The role also needs a write grant on the path. A
  docset without `config.edit` has no one who can change its folder rules.

## HTTP inbox credentials

Inbox upload credentials are not OAuth tokens. OAuth authenticates the token
management endpoints (`POST/GET /inbox/tokens`, `DELETE /inbox/tokens/{id}`),
while a generated `olin_...` bearer or HMAC authenticates
`POST /inbox/{docset}`. The CLI equivalents are:

```bash
openlore inbox token create --identity alice --ttl 24h --config openlore.yml
openlore inbox token list --config openlore.yml
openlore inbox token revoke TOKEN_ID --config openlore.yml
```

Creation requires `auth_file`. At upload time the token must still exist, be
unexpired, and be bound to an exact, currently existing identity; aliases,
unknown-identity fallback, and deleted identities are rejected. That identity's
live docset grants are evaluated for every upload.

`inbox.max_upload_size` is the bounded in-memory raw HTTP body/multipart cap,
and `inbox.allowed_types` independently controls extension/MIME pairs. This
policy does not widen ordinary shell, MCP, or DirFS content/size policy.
Multipart parsing retains aggregate file-part copies no larger than the raw
body and releases the raw body before commit.

HMAC signs the exact raw body as `HMAC-SHA256(secret, "timestamp." + body)`.
Replay state is process-local, bounded to 1,000 signatures per token with a
separate 10,000-signature global guard. One full token cannot block another,
but multi-instance deployments need sticky routing or shared replay protection.

Multipart files form one ordered batch. Commits are in request order with no
rollback: if a later leaf fails, the HTTP 500 JSON includes `committed_paths`
for the durable prefix, and post-commit audit receives that exact prefix and
the actor.

## Docset paths

Each docset exposes one or more virtual paths. A path may directly mount the
corresponding source path or map a source path to a different display path:

```json
"paths": [
  "/docs/api",
  { "internal/specs": "/docs/specs" }
]
```

Authorization is evaluated against the owning docset. Nested docsets create
independent policy boundaries rather than inheriting their parent's grants.

## Path aliases

Aliases expose alternate virtual roots for a docset's first canonical path:

```json
{
  "docsets": {
    "jared": {
      "paths": ["/agent/jared"],
      "aliases": ["/jared"]
    }
  }
}
```

`/agent/jared/notes.md` and `/jared/notes.md` address the same file. Navigation
preserves the spelling used by the caller, but authorization, approvals,
changesets, hooks, events, inboxes, and `$HOME` use the canonical path.

Aliases must be absolute and normalized. They cannot overlap another alias,
mount, or canonical path at or beneath the alias.

## Identity home directories

An identity can name one unique docset as its home:

```json
{
  "name": "backend-agent",
  "public_key": "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...",
  "roles": ["backend"],
  "home": "backend-home"
}
```

The home docset's display path becomes `$HOME`, enabling `~`, `~/path`, and `cd`
with no arguments. It does not change the initial directory, which remains
`default_cwd`.

```bash
ssh -p 2222 server 'echo $HOME'
ssh -p 2222 server 'cat ~/notes.md'
ssh -p 2222 server 'cd && pwd'
```

The owner receives implicit `rw` on its home. Nested docsets remain separate
boundaries and do not inherit that access.

## Manage identities and roles

Add an identity from the CLI:

```bash
openlore identity add \
  --name my-agent \
  --key "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..." \
  --role backend \
  --home backend-home \
  --auth ./lore.json
```

`--key` is optional, allowing passkey- or token-only identities.

Manage policy with:

- `openlore role add|remove`
- `openlore role grant|revoke`
- `openlore role deny|undeny`
- `openlore role capability allow|deny|remove`
- `openlore identity role add|remove --identity NAME --role ROLE`

## SSH certificates

Use `--ca-keys` to trust CA-signed user certificates and `--host-cert` to serve a
CA-signed host certificate. This is the strongest option for environments that
operate an SSH certificate authority.

## Verify the SSH host key over HTTPS

SSH otherwise relies on trust on first use. OpenLore displays its public host
key on the web front page and serves it from `GET /host-key`. Put the HTTP server
behind TLS, then install the key before connecting:

```bash
curl -s https://docs.example.com/host-key | \
  awk '{print "[docs.example.com]:2222 " $0}' >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

ssh -p 2222 docs.example.com
```

See `examples/` for Caddy reverse-proxy configurations.
